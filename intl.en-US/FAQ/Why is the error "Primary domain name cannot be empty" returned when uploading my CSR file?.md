# Why is the error "Primary domain name cannot be empty" returned when uploading my CSR file? {#concept_u1s_lt5_ydb .concept}

## Symptoms {#section_zb1_mt5_ydb .section}

If you manually upload the CSR file, you may receive a message stating "Review failed - primary domain name cannot be empty."

## Cause {#section_ac1_mt5_ydb .section}

The Common Name field is not entered correctly during the CSR file creation.

## Resolution {#section_bc1_mt5_ydb .section}

Create and upload a new CSR file and check that the Common Name field is entered correctly.

**Note:** The Common Name field must be entered with one of the domains to be added to the certificate.

To ensure that the content of the CSR file is correct, we strongly recommend using the CSR generated by system function. This function also allows you  to download the issued certificate in different formats.
